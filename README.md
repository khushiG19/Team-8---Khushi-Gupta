About the Project

This Python code defines a Streamlit web app for scraping news articles from a specific website based on user-selected date parameters. The app includes input fields for choosing the year, month, and day of the news, along with an option to toggle between English and Hindi languages. Users can click a "Scrap" button to initiate the scraping process.

Upon clicking the "Scrap" button, the code sends a request to the specified website, extracts news articles using BeautifulSoup, and displays them in a Streamlit interface. Each news article is presented in a stylized box with a clickable link to the original article. The app provides a visual representation of the scraped news for the selected date.

Aim of the Project:
News Scraping: Extract news articles from a specific website based on user-selected date parameters.
User Interaction: Provide a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for users to input the desired date and language preferences.
Visualization: Display the scraped news articles in a visually appealing format with clickable links.

Technologies Learned:
Streamlit: Used for building interactive web applications with minimal code.
BeautifulSoup: Employed for web scraping, extracting structured data from HTML and XML files.
Requests: Utilized for sending HTTP requests to the specified website to fetch web pages.
HTML/CSS Styling: Applied to enhance the visual presentation of scraped news articles in the Streamlit app.
Python: The primary programming language for building the entire application.
